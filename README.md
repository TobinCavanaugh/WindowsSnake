Snake but each pixel is its own Windows window, shockingly NOT crossplatform
Windows only!

This is a basic C implementation of the 1997 hit game snake. The twist is that its for Windows, meaning in this case that each pixel of the game is its own window

## How to play
- Download BasicSnake.exe from the releases tab and run it!
- If I were you, I'd also perform a web virus scan on the program.

## Controls
- Arrow keys or WASD for directions.
- Press escape or q to exit.
- Clicking anywhere on the window(s) will cause them to be displayed in front.

## Motivation
- I wanted to make a stupid but still functional application using my new knowledge of C. I also wanted to learn more about the C Windows API, and I settled on making a game constructed out of windows. My first thought was tetris, however after I solved the problem of displaying and coloring windows, I realized Tetris is hard to program, and that snake would get the same point across while being much easier to program.
